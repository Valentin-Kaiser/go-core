**go-core** is a comprehensive, modular collection of Go libraries designed to accelerate professional application development. It provides robust, production-grade utilities for error handling, configuration, logging, caching, database management, security, service orchestration, and more. Each package is crafted for extensibility, reliability, and seamless integration.

## Key Features

### Error Handling
- Custom error types with stack traces and context
- Utility functions for error propagation and recovery

### Caching
- In-memory, Redis, and distributed caching
- TTL, LRU eviction, serialization, and advanced cache configuration

### Configuration Management
- Structured config loading from files, flags, and environment
- Dynamic watching, validation, and default value registration

### Logging
- Flexible logging framework with adapters for zerolog, standard log, and no-op
- Global logger registry, structured logging, and zero-allocation logger
- Log rotation and custom output targets

### Database
- Abstraction over GORM with automatic connection handling
- Schema migrations, transaction management, and multi-database support

### Flags & Interruption
- Simple API for command-line flag parsing
- Graceful shutdown and panic recovery utilities

### Memory & Machine Utilities
- Estimate memory footprint of Go values
- Unique machine ID generation and hardware info (CPU, features)

### Mail
- Comprehensive email sending and SMTP server functionality
- Security features: HELO validation, IP filtering, rate limiting
- Delivery tracking, retry logic, and template management

### Queue & Task Processing
- Background job processing system
- In-memory, Redis, and RabbitMQ support
- Scheduling, middleware, job context, and distributed execution

### Security
- Cryptographic utilities: PGP, AES encryption/decryption
- Secure operations for sensitive data and communication

### Service Management
- Service lifecycle management and deployment
- Integration with kardianos/service, shutdown handling, and cross-platform support

### Web & RPC
- Configurable HTTP server with middleware support
- JSON-RPC over HTTP and WebSocket (requires Protocol Buffer definitions for server generation)
- Rate limiting, request metadata, and automatic method dispatch

### Versioning
- Build/version info embedding and management
- Precise control over application metadata
